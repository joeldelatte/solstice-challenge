This project is a code challenge from Solstice.

The instructions were as follows:

Given this JSON file, you are asked to build a web app that should meet these requirements:
- a backend api: preferably using Nodejs, but you can use any other backend language.
- a client server: using React.

Backend API:
1- should contain the json file with the customers and accounts information and should serve the data contained within the file when requested.

Client Server:
1- In the main view/component: display in a table a list of all the customers provided in the file.
2- In a separate component: display in a table a list of all the accounts provided in the file.

When a user clicks on a single customer on the table. the user is taken to a profile view containing information about that specific customer + a table with a list of all the accounts associated with the customer.
